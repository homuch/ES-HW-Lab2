# Embedded Systems Lab 2: Wi-Fi and Sensor Data

This repository contains the solution to the following problem. To test the solution, you will need [this STM32 board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) and STM32CubeIDE with the EGit extension.

## Problem Statement

Create or modify a project on the STM32 IoT node to read sensor data, such as from the 3D accelerometer or 3D gyroscope, and transmit the data to a host device running Linux (Raspberry Pi), Windows, or macOS. The data should be visualized using a graphical tool, such as Python-based GUI software.
